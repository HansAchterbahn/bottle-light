# Bottle Light

A coaster that make your bottle glow in all colors of the rainbow


## Technical details

1. To build your own Bottle Light, you need to create a circuit board as shown in the [bottle-light-eagle](https://github.com/HansAchterbahn/bottle-light-eagle/). 
2. Then you can flash the code contained in the [bottle-light-systemworkbench](https://github.com/HansAchterbahn/bottle-light-systemworkbench/) onto the STM32 microcontroller. 
3. Finally, insert your printed circuit board into a suitable housing and have fun with your Bottle Light!
